# Snake

It's a simple project of popular game called 'snake'. The entire project was written in Python using pygame library, so you have to install it on your computer if you want to play.
I made this project based on this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=QFvqStqPCRU&ab_channel=ClearCode
